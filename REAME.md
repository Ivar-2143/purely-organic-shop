An e-commerce project that demonstrates what I have learned in the 4-week long PHP Track in Village88 Coding Bootcamp. 

This project serves as my stepping stone in understanding how complex applications works and how it's built. 

**Technologies used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, PHP, CodeIgniter, Stripe API, PHPMailer API
